6. Conclusions
6.1 Results explained 
Testing using the Welch Two-Sample t-test showed a large difference in the mean number of CPU cores between AMD A-Series Processors and AMD Ryzen Processors. The result is that the difference is statistically significant, with a p-value of 2.44e-05. AMD Ryzen processors have 7.21 cores on average vs. AMD A-Series cores on average: 3.38 cores. Analysts confirm the disparity in core counts by reporting the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference to be anywhere from -5.48 to -2.18.
6.2 Interpretation of the results 
From the results, it might be implied that the CPU cores of the AMD Ryzen processors are relatively more than those of the AMD A-Series processors, implying that they are perhaps performing much more optimally in parallel computing tasks. Since Ryzen processors could be more suitable for gaming and content creation, which are high-performance type apps, this difference could affect consumer choices. However, in the context of the broader market, this means that Ryzen can no longer be competed with just by having a lower price point. 
6.3 Reasons and/or implications for future work, limitations of your study
Future work could be made to include a wider range of AMD processor families and another set of performance metrics (clock speed, TDP), and non-parametric tests when the data may not pass normality assumptions. This study is limited because only one metric (CPU cores) is used in evaluating the performance difference.
