AMD Processor Core Comparison
Research Question
Is there a difference in the mean number of CPU cores between AMD A-Series Processors and AMD Ryzen™ Processors?

This study investigates the distribution and differences in the number of CPU cores across two processor families from AMD—A-Series Processors and Ryzen™ Processors. By analyzing CPU specifications, we aim to identify statistical differences and provide insights into core count trends.

Visualizations --->
1. Histogram of CPU Cores by Processor Family
The histogram illustrates the distribution of CPU cores for the two AMD processor families. It provides an overview of the frequency of different core counts across the Ryzen™ and A-Series families.


2. Box Plot of CPU Cores
A box plot was created to compare the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers for the number of cores in AMD A-Series and Ryzen™ Processors.

Methodology --->
Data was collected from AMD processor specifications.
Two visualizations were generated:
Histogram: Highlights distribution differences.
Box Plot: Displays statistical summaries and variation.
A hypothesis test (e.g., t-test) was conducted to determine if the mean number of CPU cores differs significantly between the two processor families.
